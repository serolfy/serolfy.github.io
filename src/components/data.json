Innovated a proxy server connecting RSE & OBE networks with a web platform for developers to code, test, and deploy new functionality. Deployed COTS V2X-RSEs at multiple locations with Kubernetes deployment supporting IoT edge computing, including a custom Docker Registry (OwlBoxHub) with custom ARM containers.",

The project used COTS components, open-source software, proprietary printed PCB boards, and software to optimize bodybuildersâ€™ dietary recovery post-workout and meal plans using macronutrients. The main device features a gyroscope, accelerometer, heart rate, blood oxygen, and force sensors interfacing with a Raspberry Pi Zero W. It uses ML with a TensorFlow backend to transmit information over BLE to a mobile app and display nutritional regeneration information from a custom REST API.",
